/**
 * Gives each execute the most time to prove before the transaction expires.
 *
 * A transaction expires a fixed number of blocks after its reference block:
 * tokens with transfer policies (e.g. a blocklist) cap it at 20 blocks, about a
 * minute on devnet, and the node wants it two blocks before that. Execute
 * pushes the delta to Guardian, which locks the account, before the proof
 * exists, so a proof that misses the window leaves the account locked.
 *
 * - The client syncs right before executing, so the reference block, and with
 *   it the window, starts at the chain tip rather than at the last sync.
 * - When a remote prover fails, the request is re-executed at the new tip and
 *   proved locally, so local proving gets a full window instead of what the
 *   remote attempt left. The local prover is authoritative: an invalid
 *   transaction fails there with the real error, and proving locally keeps the
 *   transaction data on the device.
 *
 * The SDK has no hook for this and does not retry these failures (a stream
 * abort surfaces as gRPC `unknown`), so this replaces the internal workflow's
 * `submit` with the same execute, prove, submit and apply steps. Returns false,
 * leaving the SDK untouched, if the workflow is not shaped as expected.
